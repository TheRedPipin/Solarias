*Oh... please find my sun*

## What Is This?

This is us

**Do** things. **Say** things.


## How to Enter

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser
3. Wait for the skull
4. Press any key when you're ready
5. You won't be ready

Or run a local server if the audio refuses to play. The ambience helps... I think.

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Navigate to `localhost:8000/frontend/`

## What You'll Find

It

## Controls

`Do` / `Say` — toggle the command mode  
`Enter` — submit  
`↑` `↓` — your words, returned to you  
`Escape` — there is no escape

## A Warning

Like most things this is not finished, but adventure away anyway.

Maybe you'll find the sun or maybe it'll find you.
